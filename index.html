  1. Introduction
</h2><a name="introduction"></a>

  <p align="justify">This document describes the usage of CShaperApp. CShaperApp is built based on the CShaper published in <I>Nature Communications</I>, which adopts the deep learning to segment the <I>C. elegans</I> emebyro at single-cell elevel (Cao JF <I>et al.</I>, <I>Nat. Commun</I>, 2020).</p>

  <p align="justify">Briefly speaking, CShaperApp is composed of four functional sections, including <B>Preprocess</B>, <B>Segmentation</B>, <B> Analysis</B> and  <B>Result</B>. While these four parts are designed to be excuted sequentially, they can also be used to process or anlayze the data individually if  data has already been prepared. In order to use this software efficiently, especially for <B>Segmentation</B>, GPU acceleration is preferred. However, all components has been tested successfully on basic desktop (RAM=16G, no GPU).</p>

<br/>
<h2>2. Installation</h2><a name="installation"></a>
<p align="justify">The user can download the installer of CShaperApp from this <a href="https://portland-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jfcao3-c_my_cityu_edu_hk/Es0yP5jn-mlNjX2YtsXtp3QBPdztUrx4S5RB-5_i_a-9uQ?e=OqbbxC">link</a>. The pretrained model and name dictionary can be downloaded as <a href="https://portland-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jfcao3-c_my_cityu_edu_hk/EuMA-KgH6FxLhCNJvayV-T0BJDqHi87qX1Uvnxb6ctHrDg?download=1">Resource</a> file. CShaperApp was tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10 (64 bit). For the user's reference, we list the time that CShaperApp takes to process the example dataset <a href="https://portland-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jfcao3-c_my_cityu_edu_hk/EdOYHmsTunJFvMzX1hhh24ABleMOoSRexF9Dr_eUbYvBjw?download=1">MembRaw</a>.</p>

<h2>3. Usage</h2><a name="usage"></a>
<p align="justify">With the help of microscopy, fluorescent signals of nucleus and membrane are collected through two channels respectly. These images are saved slice by slice. <B>Preprocess</B> is used to compose these slices into a volume according to the user's config. Subsequently, <B>Segmentation</B> is used to segment these volumetric images. <B>Analysis</B> is designed to collect the biological information, such as volume and surface, from the segmentation result. Finally, <B>Result</B> can be used to inspect the segmentation results interactively.</p>

You can get familiar with the usage of CShaperApp by following the steps in the figure. 

<p align="justify"><img alt="Steps of CShaperApp" src="./Framework.jpeg"></p>

<p align="justify">In these files, <code>Raw Folder</code> is the data that the user needs to process. All data generated by CShaperApp directly or indirectly will be saved to <code>Project Folder</code>. <code>Resource</code> is prequired files which are provided together with our paper. </p>

<h3>3.1 Preprocess</h3><a name="usage_preprocess"></a>
<p align=" justify">The user needs to set meta-information about the image data. An example data can be downloaded from <a href="https://portland-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jfcao3-c_my_cityu_edu_hk/EdOYHmsTunJFvMzX1hhh24ABleMOoSRexF9Dr_eUbYvBjw?download=1">MembRaw</a> (0.2G) or <a href="https://portland-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jfcao3-c_my_cityu_edu_hk/EXk6zZW8wuJMjFEZQ005rysBOfBheOV253iVdZipIvbvqA?download=1">MembRawFull</a> (1.88G). <code>MembRaw</code> only includes <I>time point=1~20</I> in <code>MembRawFull</code> in order to reduce the size of file to be downloaded or tested. The meaning of each parameters are listed as follows (based on the example data).</p>

<h4>Results</h4>
<p align="justify">Membrane and nucleus slices are composed into a volume at each time point. The volumetric images are saved as <code>*.nii.gz</code> files under folder <code>Project Folder/MembRaw</code>, which can be loaded by <a href="http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php">itk-SNAP</a>.</p>

<h3>3.2 Segmentation</h3><a name="usage_segmentation"></a>
<p align="justify">At this stage, some parameters are assumed to be the same as that of <B>Preprocess</B>. If not, the user can change the settings but please make sure the embryo to be segmented has been processed by the stage <B>Preprocess</B>.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>
<p align="justify">Volumetric raw images are further segmented at single-cell level. Segmentations are saved at folder <code>Project Folder/181210plc1p2</code>. The user can <I>visually inspect the segmentation performance by loading the raw image (from <B>Preprocess</B>) and the segmentation with itk-SNAP</I>. Please note that at this stage, cells are not strictly lablled according to the <code>name_dictionary.csv</code>, which remains to be solved in <B>Analysis</B>.</p>
<h3>3.3 Analysis</h3><a name="usage_analysis"></a>
<p align="justify">Section <B>Analysis</B> will collect cell morphological information, including cell volume, cell surface area and cell-cell contact area. It also combines two daughter cells during the the division process in which case one cell includes two nuclei.</p>

<p align="justify">The user can set all parameters in <B>Preprocess</B>, <B>Segmentation</B> and <B>Anlysis</B> once, and runs them together.</p>

<h4>Results</h4>
<p align="justify">Morphological information are saved to <code>StatShape</code>. These results can be either viewed in section <B>Result</B> or processed for different needs.</p>
<h3>3.4 Result</h3><a name="usage_result"></a>
<p align="justify">This part provides a window for the user to view both the segmentation results and the collected information. All tables are exportable for further studies. In <code>3D</code> component, the user can inspect the segmentation results at each time point interactively. Please note that because all segmentations are preloaded here, this function might be computationally consuming when there are too many time points. Besides, CShaperApp concentrates on segmenting the embryo data, so we recommend the <a href="http://www.itksnap.org">itk-SNAP</a> to the user for user-friendly interface to view the results.</p>
